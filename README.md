# Analyze A/B Test Results

This is a personal project which practices the analysis of an A/B test result dataset collected by an e-commerce website.

### Instructions

You would need to download both the [Jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/ZXKUQYB/nd002-project3/blob/main/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb), and all the CSV files in the [data](https://github.com/ZXKUQYB/nd002-project3/tree/main/data) directory to run the program code.

To setup a test run of the program code in notebook, it is recommended to use a temporary Jupyter server offered by [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/try). Be sure to choose **JupyterLab** when you get your temporary Jupyter server, since it comes with all the Python modules needed for this project already installed. Just upload the downloaded files to your temporary workspace and give it a run.

Alternatively, you can also run it in your own local environment if you prefer, but the instructions to configure a local environment will not be covered here.

### Additional Information

There is also one supplemental document file provided in this repo for your information, in case you want to see the results directly without running program code. The HTML file is simply a soft copy of the Jupyter notebook file created by using [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io), and there are some ways for you to [preview its contents online](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8446218/how-to-see-an-html-page-on-github-as-a-normal-rendered-html-page-to-see-preview) at ease if you want.
